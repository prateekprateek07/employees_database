# employees_database
In this case study,I Performed the Data analysis, Report Creation, Graphs , Charts, Bar and creation of Dashboards in Tableau Tools.
I had filter the data using SQL so that it can be easily visulaized using tableau
dashboard link- https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/prateek.prateek/viz/Book2_17060304277430/Dashboard1
Tableau extension file is added in repository
I got the data from sql file (employes databse) and filter that according to the business need.
the employees database consist of five table t_departments, t_dept_emp, t_dept_manager, t_employees, t_salaries
each table are linked to each other
Please check the Dashboard IMAGE Attached in the repository Dataset is attached as well.
I have mainly used the Employees Database for Data analysis, Report creation, Charts, Bar and creation of Dashboards.
The 4 major business question that is answered in this analysis are: 
1.create the visualization that provides the breakdown between the male and females employees
working in the company each year, starting from 1990
2. compare the number of male managers to the number of female managers from different departments
for each year, starting from 1990
3. Compare the average salary of female versus male employees in the entire company until 
 year 2002, and add a filter allowing you to see that per each department.
4.Create an SQL stored procedure that will allow you to obtain the average male and 
female salary per department within a certain salary range. Let this range be defined by 
two values the user can insert when calling the procedure.
Finally, visualize the obtained result-set in Tableau as a double bar chart.

Thanks for checking out
